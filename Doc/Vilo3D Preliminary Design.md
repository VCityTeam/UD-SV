# Vilo 3D : Preliminary Design

## Goals

* the display of historical documents whithin a 3D representation of the city
* smooth & ergonomic user exploration, of both space and time (temporal slider)
* guided / semi-guided tours to illustrate urbanization processes (docs + text)
* lay the groundwork for future serious game applications

## Positioning

* Documents in the 3d scene : most existing tools separate the 2D documents (drawings, paintings, photos, maps..) from the 3d scene. Very few examples of direct integration of documents in the 3d scene ([naive example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAWTJO6oz-o&start=58)) : still a research subject.
* Temporal exploration : is still a research subject, no existing tools.

Vilo3D will be able to provide new insights on these subjects.


## Target audience

Experts in various fields, ranging from information technology to human sciences. Tools must be easy to use for non-technicians : focus needed on ergonomy.

## Challenges

* visual clarity : image (historical doc) + text (info) + 3d scene
* user movement in 3d space + time (google map camera + temporal slider ?)
* transition between free exploration and guided tour (access, exit, resume)
* display the historical uncertainty of the 3d reconstruction

## Ideas

* display the past in grayscale (visual similarity with old photos ?)
