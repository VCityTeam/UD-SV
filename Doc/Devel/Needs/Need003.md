# Need 003: means for a guided tour through space and time

### User story
As developper & game designer, I want to implement a guided tour of the city to illustrate historical urbanization processes, as a part of the Vilo3D project. 

Sub Needs :

* [Need004](Need004.md) : integration of historical data (images & text) within a 3D representation of the city
* [Need005](Need005.md) : ergonomic user exploration of time : temporal slider 
* [Need006](Need006.md) : ergonomic user exploration of space (advanced camera control, shortcut to point of interest...)
* [Need007](Need007.md) : guided tour, between spatiotemporal points of interest, which the user can enter/leave/return to at will
* [Need008](Need008.md) : ability to display the historical uncertainty of the 3d reconstruction
* [Need009](Need009.md) : ability to use texture in the 3d scene
* [Need010](Need010.md) : multiple representations of the city (override of generic behavior & geometry, while in guided tour)

### Description

(to do)

### Notes:

* Target audience : Experts in various fields, ranging from information technology to human sciences. Tools must be easy to use for non-technicians (focus needed on ergonomy).
* Challenges : visual clarity (image (historical doc) + text (info) + 3d scene), user movement in 3d space + time, transition between free exploration and guided tour (access, exit, resume), display the historical uncertainty of the 3d reconstruction.
* Ideas : display the past in grayscale (visual similarity with old photos ?)
