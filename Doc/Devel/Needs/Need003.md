# Need 003: means for a guided tour through space and time

### User story
As developper & game designer, I want to implement a guided tour of the city to illustrate historical urbanization processes, as a part of the Vilo3D project. 

Sub Needs :
* integration of historical data (images & text) whithin a 3D representation of the city
* ergonomic user exploration of space (camera control, shortcut to point of interest...)
* ergonomic user exploration of time : temporal slider 
* 'guided tour' : points of interest linked together, which the user can enter/leave/return to at will
* ability to display the historical uncertainty of the 3d reconstruction

### Description

(to do)

### Notes:

* Target audience : Experts in various fields, ranging from information technology to human sciences. Tools must be easy to use for non-technicians (focus needed on ergonomy).
* Challenges : visual clarity (image (historical doc) + text (info) + 3d scene), user movement in 3d space + time, transition between free exploration and guided tour (access, exit, resume), display the historical uncertainty of the 3d reconstruction.
* Ideas : display the past in grayscale (visual similarity with old photos ?)
