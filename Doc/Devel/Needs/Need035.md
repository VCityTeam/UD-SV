### User story
As a [City Knowledgeable Person](Roles.md#city-knowledgeable-person) I can define the contents of Extended Documents shared in my scientific domain. 
As a [developer](https://github.com/MEPP-team/RICT/blob/master/Doc/Devel/Needs/Roles.md#developer) 
I want to translate the historian provided knowledge into a formal structure of Extended Documents 
that is based on well known types (text, images, audio, video).
