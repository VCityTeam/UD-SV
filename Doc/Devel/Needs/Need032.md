### Description
A tool that allows a user to pick up an image, see it on the scene, then place/orient/scale it and validate its position using the mouse and keyboard.
We need to define how we want the documents to be visualized (billboard or 2D screen overlay) in order to provide an adequate tool. Or implement both and give the user the choice between both visualization modes.
