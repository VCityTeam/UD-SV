## Need 004: integration of medias (images, text, audio, video, etc.) within a 4D (spatio-temp) representation of the city

### How to improve this need
 - where are the media stored? In a remote data base hosted by historians or in a to be created by VCity database ? 

### User story:
As an historian, I want to be able to add, modify, delete the [media links](https://github.com/MEPP-team/RICT/blob/master/Doc/Devel/Needs/Definitions.md#media-reference), [city object links](https://github.com/MEPP-team/RICT/blob/master/Doc/Devel/Needs/Definitions.md#city-object-reference) and [scenario links](https://github.com/MEPP-team/RICT/blob/master/Doc/Devel/Needs/Definitions.md#scenario-reference) so that I can provide more information about [city objects](https://github.com/MEPP-team/RICT/blob/master/Doc/Devel/Needs/Definitions.md#city-object) or [regions of the city](https://github.com/MEPP-team/RICT/blob/master/Doc/Devel/Needs/Definitions.md#region-of-a-city-model-fixme) model.
FIXME VJA: what do you mean by "I can source metadata information linked to city objects"

### Beneficiary role:
[Researchers (historians, geographers, urbanists)](https://github.com/MEPP-team/RICT/blob/master/Doc/Devel/Needs/Roles.md#city-knowledgeable-person) and [general audience](https://github.com/MEPP-team/RICT/blob/master/Doc/Devel/Needs/Roles.md#general-audience)

### Impact: 
Major

### Maturity: immature. 

### Cost evaluation:

### Description
Researchers and practitionners using virtual representations of cities need to add/attach documents to these representations in order to complement them. These documents are heterogeneous medias (images, text, audio, video, etc.), can come from multiple sources (i.e. from random citizen to experts) and can be linked to different scales objects (i.e. smokestack, bridge, city, etc.). Most of the time, these documents are linked to objects through their semantic information but they might also only be linked to geometry ?
To answer this need we might implement the model allowing to store documents ([Samuel et al. 2016])
