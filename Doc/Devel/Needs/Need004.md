## Need 004: Enhancing city models with documents

### User story:

As an historian, I want to be able to enhance city models with documents. I want to be able to manage, visualise (in the 3D scene as billboard AND in the document browser) and interact with the documents. I also want to be able to associate them with city object(s) and/or other document(s).

Sub Needs:

  * Need 013: [Visualization of documents within a 3D representation of the city](https://github.com/MEPP-team/RICT/blob/master/Doc/Devel/Needs/Need013.md)

  * Need 014: [Manage documents and their links with other city objects and documents](https://github.com/MEPP-team/RICT/blob/master/Doc/Devel/Needs/Need014.md)

  * Need 015: [Oriented camera mode for documents](https://github.com/MEPP-team/RICT/blob/master/Doc/Devel/Needs/Need015.md)

  * Need 020: [manage (CRUD) extended documents](https://github.com/MEPP-team/RICT/blob/master/Doc/Devel/Needs/Need020.md)

### Description
Researchers and practitionners using virtual representations of cities need to add/attach documents to these representations in order to complement them. These documents are heterogeneous medias (images, text, audio, video, etc.), can come from multiple sources (i.e. from random citizen to experts) and can be linked to different scales objects (i.e. smokestack, bridge, city, etc.).
