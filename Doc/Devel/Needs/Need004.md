### User story:
As an historian, I want to be able to add, modify, delete and access medias so that I can source metadata information linked to city objects, scenarios of urban evolution, etc.  and / or give more information about city objects or regions of the city model.

### Beneficiary role:
Researchers (historians, geographers, urbanists) and general audience

### Impact: 
Major

### Maturity:
immature

### Cost evaluation:

### Description
Researchers and practitionners using virtual representations of cities might need to add documents to these representations in order to complement them. These documents are heterogeneous medias (images, text, audio, video, etc.), can come from multiple sources (i.e. from random citizen to experts) and can be linked to different scales objects (i.e. smokestack, bridge, city, etc.). Most of the time, these documents are linked to objects through their semantic information but they might also only be linked to geometry ?
To answer this need we might implement the model allowing to store documents ([Samuel et al. 2016])
