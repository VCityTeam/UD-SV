# RICT developer's central

## Step by step inception guide

1. **Pre-requisites** 
   Checkout the [[list of languages/tools pre-requisites|DeveloperPrerequisites]] in order to develop wihin RICT.
1. **Access rights** 
   * Provide your github login in order to ask for a Github access (if you are reading this you probably already did :-)
1. **Documentation** 
   * Look for the [Doc/Devel subdirectory](https://github.com/MEPP-team/RICT/tree/master/Doc/Devel)
1. **Accessing the project sources** 
     Read on the proposed [[Github's good practices|Coding-Github_Cycle]].
1. **Installation**: build, test, run 
   * The [standard RICT/Install.md](https://github.com/MEPP-team/RICT/blob/master/Install.md) must be operational. If they are not fix them.
1. **Contributing code**
   * Read and respect [[RICT's coding style guide|Coding-Style]]
   * [[Submit a pull request (PR)|Coding-Github_Cycle#submitting-a-pull-request-pr]]: don't forget to provide a template. Don't forget: it is much better to often submit small yet effective and mature PR than jumbo/bulk PR once in a while...
   * Place and maintain some gentle pressure when [[asking for your pull request (PR) acceptation|Coding-Github_Cycle#pull-request-pr-acceptance-policy]]
