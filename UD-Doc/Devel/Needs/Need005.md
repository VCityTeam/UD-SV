# Need 005: Adding a temporal dimension to city models

### User story
As an [historian](Roles.md#city-knowledgeable-person), I want to add a temporal dimension to city models. I want to be able to store different versions of city models corresponding to different periods of time. I also want to be able to visualise the evolution of the city along the time using a 4D (spatio-temporal) representation of the city.
