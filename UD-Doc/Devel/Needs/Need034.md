# Need 034: Improved temporal navigation slider

[Issue 47](https://github.com/MEPP-team/RICT/issues/47)

### User story
As a [City Knowledgeable Person](https://github.com/MEPP-team/RICT/blob/master/Doc/Devel/Needs/Roles.md#city-knowledgeable-person), I want to navigate in time and in multiple scenarios.

### Beneficiary role:

### Cost evaluation:

### Tags or keywords
Viewpoints (historical), scenario, visualization

### Description
The explanation of the (historical) evolution of an element or a part of a city (or a city as a whole) is not unique.
Depending on their knowledge and/or their scientific domain many City Knowledgeable Person might wish to provide as many different explanations.
Thus the need arose to provide a way to visualize multiple (overlayed in time) versions of the city. 
For example, one historian has a scenario (sequence of chronological events supported by extended documents) that explains the events that led to the construction of one particular building. However, another historian might have a different scenario/explanation that leads to the construction of the same building. 
The user wants to navigate (select a particular alternative) between the available scenarios and then visualize the selected one.
