### User story

As a [City Knowledgeable Person](Roles.md#city-knowledgeable-person) I want to be able to share an [Extended Document](Definitions.md#extended-document) (as defined by [need 35](Need035.md)) through a web based site.

### Tags or keywords

### Component
 * [Authoring interface](Definitions.md#authoring-interface)

### Description
A user-friendly interface that allows the user to upload one file (picture, drawing...) at a time along with specifying the metadata.
 
### Notes:
This need differs from [Need 028](Need028.md): need 028 is a process (e.g. script) allowing the importation of a set of extended documents whereas this need focuses on submitting a single document through an web based interface.
