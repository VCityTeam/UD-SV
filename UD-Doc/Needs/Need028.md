[Associated issue 38](https://github.com/MEPP-team/UD-SV/issues/38)

### User story

### Cost evaluation: 

### Tags or keywords

### Description:
We require a mechanism allowing users to CRUD from:
  * a set of documents
  * a set of description files (e.g. excel files) giving infomation about such documents, e.g. links/references to other city objects, dates, origin, etc.

The data model must be consistent with the one of [Need 20](Need020.md)

### Notes

This need differs from [Need 014](Need028.md). Need 028 is a process (e.g. script) allowing to import extended documents in the database from e.g. an excel file and a set of files. Need 014 is a user friendly interface above this process.
